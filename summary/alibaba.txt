## 1. Protagonist

**Name:** Ali Baba (알리바바)
**Age:** Estimated 35-40 years old
**Gender:** Male
**Appearance:** A weathered, lean man with sun-darkened skin from years of outdoor labor. His hands are calloused and rough from chopping wood daily. He has dark brown hair, slightly unkempt, and deep-set brown eyes that reflect both hardship and inherent kindness. His clothing consists of simple, patched garments - a worn brown tunic, loose-fitting trousers, and leather sandals. Despite his poverty, he maintains a clean appearance and carries himself with quiet dignity.

**Personality:** Ali Baba possesses a fundamentally good heart, characterized by honesty, loyalty to family, and generosity even in poverty. He's cautious but curious, humble yet brave when necessary. His moral compass remains strong despite financial struggles, and he shows remarkable composure under pressure.

**Background:** The younger of two brothers in ancient Persia, Ali Baba inherited little from his father and married a woman as poor as himself. While his elder brother Kassim married wealth and became prosperous, Ali Baba struggles daily as a woodcutter, venturing deep into mountains to gather firewood for sale.

**Motivation:** Initially driven by survival and providing for his family, Ali Baba's discovery of the thieves' treasure transforms his motivation toward protecting his newfound fortune while maintaining his moral integrity and family bonds.

## 2. Worldbuilding

The story unfolds in a mystical version of ancient Persia where magic coexists with everyday life. The world operates on moral absolutes - good triumphs through cleverness and virtue, while evil is punished through its own greed and cruelty. 

**Rules:** Magical elements like voice-activated cave doors function reliably but require exact incantations. Wealth can be gained through fortune, but keeping it requires wisdom and loyalty. The supernatural serves justice - those who abuse power face supernatural retribution.

**Atmosphere:** A blend of harsh desert survival and Arabian Nights wonder. Daily life involves genuine hardship, but extraordinary discoveries await the worthy. The tone shifts between domestic realism and high adventure, where ordinary people can access incredible treasures but must prove themselves worthy through trials.

## 3. Temporal/Spatial Setting

**Historical Context:** Set in medieval Persia during an era of merchant caravans and tribal conflicts. Society is stratified between wealthy merchants and struggling laborers, with little middle ground.

**Geography:** The story spans from a Persian village nestled in mountainous terrain to deep forest caves. The landscape features rocky outcroppings perfect for hiding treasure, dense woodlands where bandits operate, and small communities where everyone knows their neighbors' business.

**Culture:** A society where family honor matters deeply, hospitality is sacred, and clever servants can rise in status through loyalty and wit. Marriage determines economic status, and traditional gender roles are observed, though exceptional individuals like Morgiana can transcend limitations through intelligence.

**Architecture:** Simple stone and mud-brick houses with inner courtyards, separate guest quarters, and storage areas. The magical cave represents idealized Persian palace architecture with golden decorations and vast treasure chambers that surpass royal dwellings.

## 4. Plot Summary

Ali Baba accidentally discovers forty thieves' secret cave while gathering wood. After witnessing their magical entry method ("Open Sesame"), he enters and takes three bags of gold. His wife's attempt to measure the treasure alerts his wealthy brother Kassim, who demands to know the source. Despite Ali Baba's warnings, Kassim ventures to the cave but forgets the exit command and is killed by returning thieves. Ali Baba recovers his brother's body with help from clever servant Morgiana, who arranges a believable funeral. The thieves discover their security breach and launch multiple attempts to find and eliminate the remaining threat. Morgiana repeatedly saves Ali Baba's household through her intelligence and courage, ultimately killing the thieves' leader during his final infiltration attempt. With all enemies eliminated, Ali Baba inherits the entire treasure and adopts Morgiana as his daughter.

## 5. Key Events

**Discovery of the Cave:** While hiding from approaching horsemen in a tree, Ali Baba witnesses forty armed thieves opening a massive rock face with the command "Open Sesame" (열려라, 콩). The cave interior blazes with golden decorations and contains mountains of treasure bags. This moment transforms Ali Baba from desperate woodcutter to potential wealthy man, but also marks him as a target for the thieves' vengeance.

**Kassim's Death:** Driven by greed, Kassim loads his five donkeys with treasure but forgets the exit command. When thieves return, he attempts to fight his way out but is killed and his body quartered as a warning. This event escalates the conflict and demonstrates the fatal consequences of unchecked avarice versus Ali Baba's measured approach.

**Morgiana's First Rescue:** When thieves mark Ali Baba's door with chalk to identify it, Morgiana notices and marks all neighborhood doors identically, foiling their plan. Her quick thinking and proactive protection establish her as the household's true guardian and the thieves' most dangerous opponent.

**The Oil Merchant Deception:** The thieves' leader hides thirty-seven armed men in oil jars, posing as a merchant seeking overnight shelter. Morgiana discovers the ruse when borrowing oil and hears a thief ask when to attack. She boils oil and pours it into each jar, killing all the hidden assassins. This represents the thieves' most elaborate plan and Morgiana's most decisive victory.

**Final Confrontation:** The leader returns disguised as a silk merchant, befriending Ali Baba over months before accepting a dinner invitation. Morgiana recognizes him by a distinctive mole and concealed dagger. During her entertainment dance, she stabs him fatally, ending the threat permanently. This climactic moment showcases how sustained vigilance and courage ultimately triumph over persistent evil, securing Ali Baba's fortune and family safety.
