## 1. Protagonist

**Name:** The youngest son (막내) - referred to as "Simpleton" by others
**Age:** Approximately 18-20 years old
**Gender:** Male
**Physical Appearance:** Small-framed and lean from rural life, with calloused hands from farm work. Dark brown hair, slightly unkempt and sun-bleached. Warm brown eyes that reflect his innocent nature. Sun-weathered skin from outdoor labor. Wears simple, patched peasant clothing - rough brown tunic, worn leather boots, and a hemp rope belt. Carries a weathered wooden axe.
**Personality:** Pure-hearted, generous, and naive. Possesses unwavering kindness despite being mocked as foolish. Shows genuine compassion for strangers and willingly shares even meager possessions. Demonstrates quiet determination and perseverance when facing challenges.
**Background:** Third son of poor mountain farmers, constantly ridiculed by family and community as dim-witted and useless. Lives in his older brothers' shadows, receiving little respect or support.
**Motivation:** Seeks to prove his worth to his family and find his place in the world through acts of kindness rather than cunning or strength.

## 2. Worldbuilding

The world operates on **moral magic** - where kindness is rewarded and selfishness punished through supernatural consequences. A mysterious white-haired sage serves as an agent of cosmic justice, testing mortals' character. Magic manifests through **sympathetic enchantment** (the golden goose's adhesive curse) and **transmutation** (stale bread becoming fresh). The tone balances whimsical fairy tale elements with underlying moral lessons about social class and virtue transcending birth status.

## 3. Temporal/Spatial Setting

**Historical Context:** Medieval Germanic society with rigid class hierarchies
**Geography:** Remote mountain village surrounded by dense pine forests, connected to the royal capital by winding dirt roads dotted with rustic inns
**Architecture:** Humble thatched-roof cottages with stone foundations in the village; the royal palace features towering stone walls, ornate gates, and vast storage chambers
**Culture:** Patriarchal society where youngest sons inherit little; royal court values demonstrations of power; common folk struggle with subsistence farming
**Atmosphere:** Pastoral countryside with mystical undertones, where ancient trees hide magical secrets

## 4. Plot Summary

A kind-hearted youngest son, scorned by his family, encounters a mysterious sage while attempting to prove himself through woodcutting. Unlike his selfish brothers who refuse to share food with the old man and suffer accidents, the protagonist generously shares his meager meal. Rewarded with a magical golden goose, he inadvertently creates a human chain when greedy innkeeper's daughters become magically stuck to the bird. This bizarre procession reaches the capital just as the king seeks someone to make his perpetually sad daughter laugh. The spectacle succeeds, but the king, reluctant to accept a peasant son-in-law, sets impossible tasks involving consuming vast quantities of wine and bread, plus obtaining an amphibious vessel. The sage provides magical helpers for each challenge, ultimately forcing the king to honor his promise.

## 5. Key Events

**The Brothers' Failures:** Elder brothers encounter the white-haired sage on forest paths but cruelly refuse his requests for food, suffering immediate karmic retribution through self-inflicted axe wounds - establishing the world's moral magic system.

**The Generous Meal:** The protagonist discovers his stale bread and sour wine transform into delicious food when shared with the sage, demonstrating how generosity multiplies blessings and revealing the old man's supernatural nature.

**Discovery of the Golden Goose:** Following the sage's cryptic directions, the protagonist chops down an ancient tree and discovers a goose with gleaming golden feathers nestled in its hollow trunk - his reward for pure-hearted kindness.

**The Magical Chain Formation:** At a roadside inn, three sisters attempt to steal golden feathers but become magically adhered to the goose and each other. A village magistrate, clerk, and two farmers also become trapped when trying to intervene, creating an absurd human chain of eight people dragged helplessly behind the protagonist.

**The Princess's Laughter:** The ridiculous spectacle of the struggling chain breaks the curse of the eternally melancholy princess, who laughs so hard she falls from her throne, fulfilling the king's challenge but triggering his reluctance to honor the marriage promise.

**The Impossible Challenges:** The king demands the protagonist find someone to drain an entire wine cellar and consume a warehouse of bread. The sage provides magical beings with supernatural appetites who complete these tasks effortlessly, forcing the king toward his final, most difficult demand.

**The Amphibious Vessel:** For the ultimate test, the sage himself appears with a magical boat capable of traveling on both land and water, finally compelling the king to accept the peasant as his son-in-law and demonstrating that virtue transcends social class.

**Liberation and Reward:** Upon the princess's laughter, the magical adhesion breaks, freeing all trapped individuals who flee in embarrassment, while the protagonist's transformation from scorned simpleton to royal heir shows how authentic goodness ultimately triumphs over worldly cynicism.
